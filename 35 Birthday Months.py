In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names
and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract
the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday
in each month.

Your program should output something like:
{"May": 3, "November": 2, "December": 1}
