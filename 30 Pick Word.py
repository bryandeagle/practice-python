In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word
from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save
it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s
compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble
tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.
